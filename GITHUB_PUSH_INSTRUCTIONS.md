# GitHub Push Instructions

Since the repository has been initialized and the initial commit has been created, follow these steps to push your code to GitHub:

## Option 1: Push from WSL Terminal

1. Open a WSL terminal window
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/raman/AndroidStudioProjects/chinna
   ```
3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. When prompted, enter your GitHub username and personal access token (PAT)

## Option 2: Set Up Credential Storage in WSL

To avoid entering credentials repeatedly, set up a credential helper:

1. Configure the credential manager:
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```
2. Push to GitHub (you'll be prompted for credentials only once):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Your credentials will be stored for future use

## Option 3: Use GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

1. Authenticate with GitHub:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
2. Push the repository:
   ```bash
   gh repo push
   ```

## Option 4: Push from Windows Git Bash or PowerShell

If you have issues with WSL credentials:

1. Open Git Bash or PowerShell in Windows
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\raman\AndroidStudioProjects\chinna
   ```
3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT)

If you need a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Select the necessary scopes (at minimum: `repo`)
4. Copy the generated token and use it as your password when pushing

## Verifying the Push

After pushing, visit your repository on GitHub to verify that all files have been uploaded:
