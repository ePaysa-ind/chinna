  - getSowingDate()

### 4. Navigation
- Updated **nav_graph.xml** to include SmartAdvisoryFragment
- Updated **HomeFragment.kt** to navigate to SmartAdvisoryFragment

### 5. Models
- **CropGrowthStage**: Data class for growth stage information
- **NudgeCard**: Data class for advisory cards

## Features Implemented

### 1. Growth Stage Calculation
- Automatically calculates current growth stage based on sowing date
- 5 stages: Seedling (0-15 days), Vegetative (16-45), Flowering (46-75), Fruiting (76-100), Maturity (101+)

### 2. Dynamic Nudge Cards
- 3 cards per growth stage with context-specific advice
- Weather-aware recommendations (heat stress, rain alerts)
- Priority levels: urgent, high, medium, low
- Action types: watering, fertilization, pest_control, etc.

### 3. Weather Integration
- Displays current temperature, humidity, and conditions
- Generates weather-specific alerts (heat stress, rain expected)

### 4. AI Integration
- Each nudge card has "Ask AI Advice" button
- Sends context (crop, stage, weather) to Gemini API
- Displays personalized advice in response card

### 5. Error Handling
- Offline fallback messages
- Empty state when no crop/sowing date selected
- Loading indicators for async operations

## Usage Flow
1. User selects a crop and sets sowing date (via Practices section)
2. Navigate to Smart Advisory from Home screen
3. View current growth stage and weather
4. See 3 relevant nudge cards
5. Tap card to expand and see full description
6. Click "Ask AI Advice" for detailed guidance
7. Swipe down to refresh recommendations

## Future Enhancements
- Push notifications for time-sensitive recommendations
- Historical tracking of completed actions
- Personalized recommendations based on user behavior
- Integration with IoT sensors for real-time data
- Offline AI model for basic advice without internet
