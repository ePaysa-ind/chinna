# API Key Security

## Updates Made

1. **Removed Hardcoded API Keys**
   - Removed Google Weather API key from WEATHER_API_STATUS.md
   - Removed Google Weather API key from GOOGLE_WEATHER_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md
   - Removed OpenWeatherMap API key from WEATHER_API_STATUS.md

2. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated references to API keys to indicate they are stored in local.properties
   - Added proper security notes about API key storage
   - Made sure no API keys are present in documentation files

3. **Implementation**
   - Ensured all API keys are loaded from BuildConfig variables
   - Verified that .gitignore excludes local.properties file
   - Ensured no API keys are hardcoded in source code

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **API Key Storage**
   - All API keys stored in local.properties (excluded from git)
   - Keys accessed via BuildConfig variables
   - No keys in source code or version control

2. **Security Checks**
   - Removed API keys from markdown files
   - Updated documentation to reference secure storage
   - Added validation to prevent app from running with placeholder keys

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated all documentation to comply with security best practices
   - Added notes about proper API key management
   - Included setup instructions for secure key handling

## Required Files (Not in Version Control)

1. **local.properties**
   ```properties
   # SDK location
   sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\raman\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
   
   # API Keys
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   GOOGLE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_google_weather_api_key
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
   
   # Firebase credentials
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_application_id
   ```

2. **google-services.json**
   - Contains Firebase configuration
   - Excluded from version control
   - Required for Firebase services

## Security Recommendations

1. Regularly rotate API keys
2. Use Firebase App Check in production
3. Apply API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
4. Monitor API usage for abnormal patterns
5. Use ProGuard/R8 in release builds to obfuscate code
