# Authentication and Data Persistence Fixes (May 21, 2025)

## Summary of Changes

The application has been modified to use a simplified approach for user data management:

1. **Firebase Authentication Only**
   - Firebase is now used exclusively for authentication (OTP verification)
   - All user data is stored locally in the Room database
   - No Firestore data syncing or storage

2. **Local-Only Data Storage**
   - UserRepository no longer attempts to sync with Firestore
   - Firestore methods have been converted to stubs for compatibility
   - User data is saved, retrieved, and managed using the local Room database

3. **Improved Authentication State Management**
   - Authentication state is properly preserved between sessions
   - Firebase cache is no longer cleared during logout
   - Connections are managed to maintain authentication state

4. **Database Integrity Improvements**
   - Database is only deleted when actual integrity issues are detected
   - Proper schema version checking implemented
   - Migration handling improved from village to PIN code

## Test Plan

### 1. Fresh Install Test
- Uninstall app completely
- Install and launch
- Sign up with a new phone number
- Enter user details (name, PIN code, etc.)
- Verify OTP works correctly
- Confirm user is logged in successfully
- Verify data appears in the app (user name, location, etc.)

### 2. Logout and Login Test
- Log out from the app
- Log back in with the same phone number
- Verify that user data is pre-filled
- Verify no need to re-enter signup information

### 3. App Restart Test
- Without logging out, force close the app
- Reopen the app
- Verify user remains logged in
- Verify all user data is preserved

### 4. Database Upgrade Test
- If upgrading from older version, verify migration works
- Confirm existing user data is preserved correctly
- Check that PIN code is properly handled in UI

### 5. Offline Testing
- Enable airplane mode
- Attempt to use the app features
- Verify functionality works without network connectivity
- Check that user data is accessible offline

## Implementation Details

### 1. UserRepository Changes
- Removed Firestore data syncing
- Converted syncUserFromFirestore and startFirestoreSync to stub methods
- User data is now managed exclusively through Room database and SharedPreferences

### 2. AuthActivity Changes
- Simplified login flow to focus on local database
- OTP verification remains with Firebase
- Removed Firestore sync attempts during login
- Improved input validation for PIN code

### 3. MainActivity Changes
- Modified logout process to preserve Firebase cache
- Changed from terminating Firestore to disabling network
- Improved session management and timeout handling

### 4. Database Integrity
- Enhanced database integrity checking
- Only delete database on legitimate integrity issues
- Improved logging and error recovery

## Future Recommendations

1. **Error Tracking**
   - Implement more comprehensive error tracking
   - Add analytics for OTP verification failures

2. **Offline Support**
   - Enhance offline capabilities for all features
   - Implement proper offline indicators in UI

3. **User Experience**
   - Add visual feedback during authentication
   - Improve error messages for input validation

4. **Security**
   - Implement secure storage for sensitive user data
   - Add periodic credential validation

5. **Data Backup**
   - Consider optional cloud backup for user preferences
   - Implement data export functionality
