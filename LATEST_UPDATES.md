# Latest Updates - Chinna App

**Date**: May 21, 2025

## Authentication & Data Persistence Fixes

### Issues Fixed Today:
1. **Firebase Authentication State Persistence**
   - Fixed issue where users had to re-enter all information after logging out and back in
   - Authentication state is now properly preserved across app restarts
   - User data is synced from Firestore when local database is missing information

2. **Improved Logout Process**
   - Modified logout process to preserve Firestore cache and connection state
   - Changed from aggressive termination to gentle network disabling
   - Improved handling of "CLEAN_LOGIN" flag to maintain authentication state

3. **Enhanced Data Synchronization**
   - Added proactive Firestore sync during login
   - Implemented better retrieval of user data using both UID and phone number
   - Fixed potential null reference issues in data handling

4. **Database Migration Improvement**
   - Strengthened village to PIN code migration with better safeguards
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Implemented recovery paths for migration failures

- **Added security documentation** for API key management
- **Ensured consistent terminology** across all documentation

## Technical Changes

### PIN Code Implementation
- **Added regex validation pattern** `^[1-9][0-9]{5}$` for 6-digit Indian PIN codes
- **Updated database entities** to replace village with pinCode field
- **Modified repository layer** to support the new data structure
- **Enhanced UI components** to display and collect PIN code data
- **Added proper error messages** for invalid PIN code formats

### API Security
- **Implemented secure API key handling** with BuildConfig variables
- **Removed all hardcoded keys** from markdown files and source code
- **Added key validation** to prevent app crashes with missing keys
- **Enhanced error messaging** for API key issues
- **Updated documentation** with secure key handling best practices

### WeatherService Enhancements
- **Added PIN code-based weather lookup** as primary method
- **Created location-aware caching system** that refreshes when PIN changes
- **Improved WeatherData model** with better type safety
- **Enhanced weather icons** and condition mapping
- **Added comprehensive error handling** for API failures

## Bug Fixes

### PIN Code Transition Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Compilation errors due to village to PIN code transition
- **Solution**: Updated all references to village fields to use pinCode instead
- **Impact**: Consistent use of PIN codes throughout the codebase

### API Security Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Hardcoded API keys in documentation and test files
- **Solution**: Removed all keys and implemented secure storage
- **Impact**: Better security and compliance with best practices

### Weather Service Authentication ✅
- **Problem**: API key validation issues in WeatherService
- **Solution**: Improved validation and error handling
- **Impact**: Better user experience when API keys are misconfigured

### User Experience Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Non-optimal login flow for returning users
- **Solution**: Implemented two-step process with data pre-filling
- **Impact**: Streamlined experience for both new and returning users

## Files Modified

### Key Changes
- **UserEntity.kt** and **UserData.kt**:
  - Updated data structures to use pinCode instead of village
  - Added validation for PIN code format

- **AuthActivity.kt** and **AuthActivityUpdated.kt**:
  - Implemented new authentication flow with PIN code
  - Added two-step login process with data pre-filling
  - Enhanced form validation

- **WeatherService.kt**:
  - Added PIN code-based weather lookup
  - Improved caching to respect PIN code changes
  - Enhanced error handling and logging
