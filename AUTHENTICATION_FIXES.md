# Authentication Flow Fixes (2025-05-19)

## Critical Issues Fixed

1. **Black Screen After Logout**: Fixed issue where app would show a black screen after logging out
2. **Login Screen Flickering**: Resolved problem with login screen continuously blinking/recreating
3. **Firebase Security Rules**: Improved auth flow to work properly with Firestore security rules

## Files Modified

1. **MainActivity.kt**:
   - Implemented proper logout sequence that respects Firebase security rules
   - Added Firebase connection termination before auth token invalidation
   - Added progress dialog during logout for better user experience
   - Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms

2. **AuthActivity.kt**:
   - Added recreation loop prevention with static flag
   - Improved authentication initialization process
   - Added proper handling for "clean login" after logout
   - Fixed Firebase state management during activity transitions

## Technical Details

### Logout Sequence (MainActivity.kt)

The correct logout sequence is critical and must preserve this order:

```kotlin
// 1. First disconnect Firebase listeners to prevent security rule violations
disableAllFirebaseListeners()

// 2. Clear shared preferences
// ... shared preferences clearing code ...

// 3. Clear local repository data BEFORE signing out
userRepository.logout()

// 4. ONLY THEN sign out of Firebase (after all data operations)
val auth = FirebaseAuth.getInstance()
auth.signOut()

// 5. Force clear Firebase cache AFTER signout
// ... cache clearing code ...

// 6. Navigate to login screen
```

### Security Rules Implementation

Firebase security rules now use the `admins` collection to identify admin users rather than hardcoding UIDs:

```javascript
function isAdmin() {
  return request.auth != null && 
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.uid));
}
```

The `/admins` collection contains a document with the admin's UID as its document ID.

## DO NOT REVERT THESE FIXES

These fixes address fundamental issues with the authentication flow and Firebase security rules. Reverting them will reintroduce the black screen and flickering login issues.

If modifications to the authentication flow are needed, ensure they maintain:

1. Proper sequencing of operations
2. Connection cleanup before auth token invalidation
3. Prevention of activity recreation loops
4. Proper error handling and recovery

## Testing

After any changes to auth-related code, test the following scenarios:

1. Logging out from various screens
2. Logging in after logout 
3. App restart after logout
4. Handling of expired sessions
