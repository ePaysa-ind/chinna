# User Data Persistence Fix

## Problem Identified

I've found the root cause of the user data persistence issue. The app was intentionally deleting all user data from the local database during logout. Specifically, in `UserRepository.kt`, the `logout()` method was calling `userDao.deleteAllUsers()` which completely cleared the user table.

This meant that even though the Firebase authentication state might be preserved, the app couldn't find the user's details in the local database after logging back in, forcing users to re-enter all their information.

## Fix Applied

1. **Modified UserRepository.logout() method**
```kotlin
// Before:
suspend fun logout() {
    userDao.deleteAllUsers()  // This was deleting all user data
    prefsManager.clearAll()   // This cleared all preferences
    // Keep Firebase Auth logout handled in MainActivity
}

// After:
suspend fun logout() {
    // Don't delete user data from database anymore, just clear login state
    // userDao.deleteAllUsers() - Removed to preserve user data between sessions
    
    // Only clear login status in preferences, not all preferences
    prefsManager.saveUserLoggedIn(false)
    
    // Keep Firebase Auth logout handled in MainActivity
}
```

2. **Added selective preference clearing in PrefsManager**
```kotlin
// Added new method to clear only login state but preserve other preferences
fun clearLoginState() {
    prefs.edit()
        .remove(KEY_USER_LOGGED_IN)
        .apply()
}
```

3. **Improved MainActivity logout process**
```kotlin
// Before:
// Clear shared preferences after disconnecting listeners
getSharedPreferences("selected_crop", Context.MODE_PRIVATE).edit().clear().apply()
getSharedPreferences(PREF_NAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE).edit().clear().apply()

// After:
// Only clear session-related preferences, not all preferences
// This preserves user preferences while ending the session
getSharedPreferences(PREF_NAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE).edit().remove(KEY_LAST_ACTIVITY).apply()
```

## Expected Outcome

With these changes:

1. User data will remain in the local Room database after logout
2. When users log back in, the app will find their details in the database using their phone number
3. No need to re-enter signup information after logging back in
4. Firebase authentication will still work as before for OTP verification

## Explanation

The problem wasn't in the Firebase to local storage synchronization; it was much simpler. The app was deliberately wiping the local database during logout, which meant there was no data to retrieve when logging back in.

By preserving the database records and only changing the login state in preferences, we maintain user data between sessions while still properly handling authentication.

## Testing Instructions

1. Install the updated app
2. Sign up with a phone number and enter user details
3. Log out from the app
4. Log back in with the same phone number
5. Verify that your information is still there without having to re-enter it
