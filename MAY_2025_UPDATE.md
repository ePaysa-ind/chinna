# May 2025 Updates

## PIN Code Implementation & Auth Flow Enhancement
**Date:** May 20, 2025

### Key Updates

1. **PIN Code-Based Location**
   - Replaced village names with 6-digit Indian PIN codes for precise location identification
   - Implemented PIN code validation (regex pattern for Indian format)
   - Enhanced weather API integration to use PIN codes for more accurate data
   - Added fallback mechanism to device GPS when PIN code lookup fails

2. **User Authentication Improvements**
   - Created a new two-step login flow:
     - Step 1: Mobile number verification
     - Step 2: User details (with PIN code field)
   - Added auto-detection of returning users
   - Implemented smart pre-filling of user data for returning users
   - Converted AuthActivity to AuthActivityUpdated with improved UX

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Removed all hardcoded API keys and sensitive data
   - Implemented secure key storage in local.properties
   - Added proper SHA-256 fingerprint management
   - Created documentation for keystore management (KEYSTORE_INFO.md)
   - Updated .gitignore to exclude sensitive files

4. **Testing Updates**
   - Removed hardcoded test data from WeatherApiTest
   - Implemented environment variable-based test configuration
   - Added proper validation to prevent test failures

5. **Documentation**
   - Created PIN_CODE_IMPLEMENTATION.md for technical details
   - Updated README.md with new features and setup requirements
   - Improved developer onboarding documentation

### Next Steps

1. Monitor PIN code accuracy for weather data
2. Consider adding PIN code-to-location mapping cache for offline use
3. Evaluate adding state/district dropdown as fallback if PIN lookup fails
4. Gather user feedback on the new authentication flow
