# Development Session Template

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: AUTHENTICATION FLOW FIXED ON 2025-05-19. DO NOT REVERT LOGOUT SEQUENCE FIXES IN MainActivity.kt AND AuthActivity.kt THAT PREVENT BLACK SCREENS AND LOGIN FLICKERING! THESE FIXES HANDLE FIREBASE SECURITY RULES AND AUTH STATE TRANSITIONS.** ⚠️

## Session Start: [Date/Time]

### 1. Current State Assessment
- [ ] App compiles successfully
- [ ] All features working:
  - [ ] Login/Registration flow
  - [ ] Home screen displays correctly
  - [ ] Navigation works
  - [ ] Data persistence works
- [ ] Document any known issues

### 2. Today's Objectives
1. [Specific task 1]
2. [Specific task 2]
3. [Specific task 3]

### 3. Pre-Work Analysis

#### Active Implementations
- Login: AuthActivity (launcher) / LoginFragment (unused)
- Navigation: Bottom navigation with 5 items
- Database: Version 2 with soilType field

#### Files to be Modified
1. `path/to/file1.kt` - Purpose of change
2. `path/to/file2.xml` - Purpose of change

#### Potential Impacts
- Feature X might be affected because...
- Need to check Y for compatibility
- Migration required for Z

### 4. Change Log

#### Change #1: [Description]
- File: `path/to/file.kt`
- What: Added Toast import
- Why: Using Toast for error messages
- Impact: None
- Status: ✅ Complete

#### Change #2: [Description]
- File: `path/to/layout.xml`
- What: Added soil type dropdown
- Why: User registration requires soil type
- Impact: Need to update Activity code
- Status: ✅ Complete

### 5. Testing Checklist

After each change:
- [ ] Code compiles
- [ ] No new warnings
- [ ] Feature works as expected
- [ ] Existing features still work
- [ ] UI displays correctly

### 6. Issues Encountered

#### Issue #1: Missing Import
- Problem: Toast class not imported
- Solution: Added import android.widget.Toast
- Prevention: Always check imports before using classes

#### Issue #2: Layout Mismatch
- Problem: Code expects etSoilType but layout missing
- Solution: Added field to layout
- Prevention: Update layout before code

### 7. End of Session Summary

#### Completed
- ✅ Added soil type to AuthActivity
- ✅ Fixed compilation errors
- ✅ Updated database schema

#### Pending
- ⏳ Test full registration flow
- ⏳ Verify data persistence
- ⏳ Update documentation

#### Known Issues
- LoginFragment has duplicate implementation (not used)
- Need to consolidate login flows

### 8. Next Session Preparation

1. Start by running these checks:
   ```bash
   grep -r "AuthActivity" --include="*.xml"
   grep -r "LoginFragment" --include="*.kt"
   ```

2. Verify these features work:
   - User registration with all fields
   - Data saves to database
   - Navigation between screens

3. Priority tasks:
   - Consolidate login implementations
   - Add unit tests for registration
   - Document API endpoints

### 9. Lessons Learned

1. Always check which implementation is active
2. Verify layouts match code expectations
3. Include imports before using classes
4. Test incrementally after each change

## Quick Reference

### Project Structure
```
- AuthActivity: Main login (launcher)
- LoginFragment: Alternate login (unused)
- MainActivity: Main app container
- Database v2: Includes soilType field
```

### Key Files
- `/ui/auth/AuthActivity.kt` - Active login
- `/ui/auth/LoginFragment.kt` - Inactive login
- `/di/AppModule.kt` - Dependency injection
- `/data/local/database/` - Database entities

### Common Commands
```bash
# Find active implementation
grep -r "android.intent.action.MAIN" --include="*.xml"

# Check for compilation errors
./gradlew compileDebugKotlin

# Run lint checks
./gradlew lint
```
